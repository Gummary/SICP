与and-gate的不同就是名字与logical-or

~~~scheme
(define (or-gate a1 a2 output)
  (define (or-action-procedure)
    (let ((new-value
	    (logical-or (get-signal a1) (get-signal a2))))
      (after-delay or-gate-dely
		   (lambda ()
		     (set-signal! output new-value)))))
  (add-action! a1 or-action-procedure)
  (add-action! a2 or-action-procedure))

(define (logical-or s1 s2)
  (if (or (= s1 1)
	  (= s2 1))
    1
    0))
